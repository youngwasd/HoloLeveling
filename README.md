## 🧠 About This Project

This project was created during the winter of 2024, in my web game development course. This project was my group's assignment for the class.

We decided that we wanted to create a roguelike game, since we all enjoyed this genre. We took inspiration from Vampire Survivors to help us come up with ideas for this game.

## ✨ Key Features

-   **Interactive UI**: Users use mouse + keyboard to play the game, and there is also terrain that the users must navigate through to run and kill the enemies
-   **Randomized World Generation**: At each stage, the world will randomly generate a new terrain, so the experience is refreshing each time
-   **Increased Difficulty**: There are multiple types of enemies throughout the game, each with its unique abilities. Plus, a boss stage every few rounds.
